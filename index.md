<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="profile-container">
<div class="profile-content" markdown="1">

I am a Principal Research Scientist at Siemens Energy in Berlin, Germany. My research interests include **score-based generative models** and robustness of deep neural networks. 
My current focus at Siemens Energy is to work on innovative machine learning solutions to computational fluid dynamics simulations.

Previously, I worked at Zalando where I prototyped virtual try-on systems for high resolution digital humans wearing curated outfits using generative models. 

I received my PhD in machine learning under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert Müller. The thesis primarily focused on score-based generative models and robustness of deep neural networks.
